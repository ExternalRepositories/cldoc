# Getting started
Before you can get started with documenting your code and generating a beautiful
website for it, you first need to install cldoc. This is a fairly simple process,
and the instructions below should allow you to install cldoc in a few minutes.

Before you start, make sure you have at least **libclang 3.9**
installed on your system. Most recent distributions ship packages of recent
enough `libclang`.

# 1. Installing using pip
cldoc is avaible at the [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cldoc/).
This is by far the easiest way to install cldoc. Make sure you have `pip`
installed (install `python-pip` on `ubuntu` and `fedora`) Simply use
`pip install --user cldoc` (you might need to use the `python-pip` command instead
on fedora). The `--user` will install cldoc locally in `~/.local`. If you want
to install it globally in your system, use `sudo pip install cldoc` instead.

# 2. Installing from source
First checkout the latest source from [git](https://github.com/jessevdk/cldoc).
cldoc itself is written in **python**, so you will also need that installed (all
systems normally already have it installed). cldoc works with either python 2.7
or python3 as of version 1.11.

## Runtime dependencies when installing from source
The only additional runtime dependency besides libclang is the **pyparsing**
python library. You can get it from your distribution, or use
`pip install pyparsing`.

cldoc by default generates a dynamic site, but can also optionally generate a
static site instead. To generate a static site, you need to install the cldoc-static
npm module (npm install -g cldoc-static).

## Build dependencies
* coffeescript compiler
* sass compiler
* inline-source

These build dependencies are used to generate the html webapp which renders
the documentation generated by cldoc. All dependencies can be installed via
`npm` (using `npm install`).

After the requirements are installed, first run `python setup.py generate` to
generate the webapp. After that simply run `python setup.py install` to
install cldoc. Note that if you have used npm to install coffeescript and
sass locally (i.e. in node_modules/), use:

```
    python setup.py generate \
        --coffee=node_modules/.bin/coffee \
        --sass=node_modules/.bin/node-sass
```

or something similar depending on where they actually got installed. You only
need to do this if the `coffee` and `node-sass` executables are not in
your `$PATH`.

# Installation completed
After following these steps you should have successfully installed cldoc!
Continue to [Documenting code](documenting.html) or directly to
[Generating site](generating.html).
